## 🚀 About The Project

**VORTEX AI** is not just a chatbot; it is a high-performance, latency-free **Neural Interface**. Designed with a **Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi aesthetic**, it features a holographic HUD, persistent memory banks, and real-time data synchronization.

  Built to simulate a futuristic operating system, it leverages **NVIDIA's LLM infrastructure** to provide intelligent, context-aware responses that "remember" previous conversations.

### ✨ Key Features (The "Heavy" Stuff)
* **🧠 Infinite Neural Memory:** Remembers context across sessions using **Firebase Firestore Vector Storage**.
* **⚡ Quantum Speed:** Optimized React architecture with **Framer Motion** for 60FPS animations.
* **🛡️ Military-Grade Security:** End-to-End authentication via Google Firebase.
* **🖥️ Holographic HUD UI:** Glassmorphism design with glowing neon borders and glitch effects.
* **🌪️ 3D Interactive Elements:** Tilt-aware cards and magnetic buttons using physics-based animations.
**🤖 Neural Terminal:** A simulated hacker console executing system commands in real-time.
